Simulator (bug fixes):
- Fix "roaming agent", i.e. when a path ends before goal location it continues
  in the direction it previously had. It should stop instead.

Simulator (new features):
- Add deviations (map changes each time step)
- Change color of agent when it reaches goal / cannot reach goal
- Add support for wait operation (agents may wait at a position before
  continuing)


Map generator (new features):
- Have default arguments (i.e. if all arguments are not specified, run anyway)
- Add option to specify start/goal positions of agents
